# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As the SDK is in prerelease state, only the latest release will be supported. 

This policy will be reviewed once the project reaches a feature-complete state.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabilities as GitHub issues. They will be addressed as and when I can.

If the issues are with the Mendeley API rather than the SDK, contact them directly.
